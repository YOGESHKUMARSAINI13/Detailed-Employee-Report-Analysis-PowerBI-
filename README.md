Industry ContextThis project is related to the Hospitality Industry, where analyzing demand and supply in the market is crucial. Understanding these factors helps the hotel industry improve services and gain a competitive advantage. The Hotel Booking Analysis Project focuses on examining various aspects such as:

Booking trends

Seasonal fluctuations

Customer demographics

Impact of external factors on booking behaviors

Popular room preferences

Effects of promotions and marketing efforts on booking volumes

ObjectiveAs an analyst, my objective for this project was to:

Develop a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to systematically visualize hotel booking data.

Identify trends and patterns across key parameters such as Customer Segmentation, Cancellation Analysis, and Trend Analysis.

About the DataTo fulfill the objective, I used data provided by AlmaBetter, which includes:

Booking cancellations

Lead time

Arrival date

Average daily rate (ADR)

Country of the guests

Data PreprocessingTo ensure data quality and reliability, I performed:

Identification and imputation of missing values

Removal of null values

String manipulations and standardization of categorical columns

Correction of improper data entries

Final dataset: 90K rows and 32 columns

Insights & Actionable Insights from Power BI DashboardOnce the data was ready, I built a Power BI Dashboard with the following components:

KPI Cards

Total Canceled Bookings: 44K (37.04%)

Total Not Canceled Bookings: 75K (62.96%)

Total Transactions: 119K bookings

Filter Panel

Filters to analyze report data Country-wise and Month-wise

Charts and Visualizations

Bookings by Hotel Type (Column Chart)

City Hotel: 33K canceled, 11K not canceled

Resort Hotel: 6K canceled, 11K not canceled

Insight: Higher cancellation rates in City Hotels compared to Resort Hotels.

Outcome ðŸ˜€The Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of hotel booking behaviors, highlighting key trends and cancellation patterns. These insights help hotel management:

Understand factors driving cancellations

Implement strategies to improve booking retention

Optimize revenue management

This project demonstrates how data analysis and visualization can empower decision-making in the hotel industry, improving overall efficiency and profitability.
